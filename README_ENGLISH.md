## My project experience.

### BtoB service home delivery application development [TypeScript/AndroidStudio/React and React Native/Xcode/Git/Jira/Azure/Sketch/SketchCloud] (2020-present)

Project Summary: Responsible for UI and UX implementation, CI infrastructure construction, and development work for introducing and reviewing new functions in a new development team for BtoB service delivery.

In addition to the above, you will be responsible for the design of the entire application class (DTO, screen), the implementation of functions around the location using Google Maps, the implementation of various screens, testing and debugging, etc. The following is a brief description of the job. (The number of workers is about 8)
 
 - Training and technical support for newcomers
 - Creation of environment construction procedures and environment construction support
 - Source review
 - Technical research for implementation of new functions
 - Research and operation of APIs such as GoogleMap
 - UI/UX implementation
 - Implementation of Linter and Formatter
 - Release work
 - Git branch management
 - Creation of documents such as screen design documents and screen transition diagrams
 - Design creation and specification modification based on the latest needs
 - Installation and update of APIMock server

Although I had no experience in map implementation or TypeScirpt, I quickly caught up with information from books and the Internet, as well as with the support of the team leader, and was able to research and understand the permission application flow for Android and IOS cameras, which even the team leader did not know at the time. He showed his high learning ability here as well. He still has a high level of ability to read source code and search for information, which was helpful in selecting technologies, sharing library usage, and visualizing tasks (using signs).

### App Development/New Feature Addition for English Study and Conversation Practice Service of a Company [ActionScript/Junit/Flash AIR] (2019)

Project Summary: An application that provides English conversation practice lessons, English test support and other services using the latest voice recognition API.

You will be responsible for designing the overall architecture of the application, building a CI/CD environment using Jenkins, and working on functions around the screen and voice. Specifically, you will be responsible for the following

- Using the speech recognition API, create a useful speech recognition library by combining it with the app's recording and playback functions.
- Technical support (mainly implementation of animations)
- Unit testing and integration testing
- Modification of the voice system architecture (recording, playback, storage) for new features
- Use API to store and operate lesson data
- Implementation of Jenkins CI Pipeline

Demonstrated value] Demonstrated high learning ability here as well, learned and caught up with ActionScript and Jenkins in a short period of time. Implemented functions around the voice part of the core of this application. The ability to read source code allowed us to resolve more than half of the app's latent bugs in the coding stage.

### A certain company's car insurance service/FrontEnd/BackEnd [Java/Vue.js/Jest/Oracle/Redis/Spring Framework/Webpack/Github/maven] (2019)

Project Summary: FrontEnd and BackEnd for a company's car insurance service.

You will be responsible for designing the overall architecture of the application, building the CI/CD environment using Jenkins, and working on functions around the screen and voice. Specifically, you will be responsible for the following

- Development environment construction and documentation
- Technical support (Jest testing)
- Source review
- Implementation of insurance quote API
- Definition of UI units by Atomic Design
- FrontEnd leader is an American, so we used English to communicate and exchange opinions
- Git support (Conflict resolution, Rebase, etc.)
- Implemented a testing environment

[Demonstrated Value] Although this was my first experience with Vue.js, I was able to catch up in a short period of time by demonstrating my ability to learn quickly. I researched how to write test cases around Jest in the technical research team, and shared how to write test cases with the development team members. However, he was able to contribute to the team in many ways by demonstrating his strengths of quick learning and utility.

### Official app for a major bank of Japan [Kotlin/MVP/JavaScript/Retrofit/Realm/MoneyTreeApi/Xcode/Swift/GitLab/TestFlight/Moduleization] (2018)

Project Summary] Development of an official application for a major bank of Japan.

[Responsibilities] Functional implementation and source review by architectural design MVP, building Beta testing environment by TestFlight, functional implementation and testing around the screen.

- Android/IOS Actual device testing, unit testing, and integration testing.
- Mock server implementation
- CharlieDebug environment construction and instruction
- Screen implementation of household budget management module
- Creation of screen transition diagrams
- Specification change support
- Git support (Conflict resolution, Rebase, etc.)
- Android multi-language support 
- Research and implementation of mobile DB encryption technology

Although this was my first project in Japan, I contributed greatly to the team's productivity by utilizing my know-how, development experience, English and Japanese. Although this was his first experience with modularized development, he made full use of various books and internet information to find out bugs caused by complex Logic.
