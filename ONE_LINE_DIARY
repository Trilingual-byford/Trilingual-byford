April 26 I've been thinking about what kind of person should be called a procrastinator.I think that i'm one of them because I keep putting off the thing that i don't feel like doing,but it is necessary.
April 27 I slacked off at work.Staying at home the whole day made me feel like i'm isolated from the world
April 28 I stayed up playing games; I felt like garbage.
April 29 I hanged out with an Australia friend,we went to karaok,I singed 2 hours 30 minutes song tried chinese songs,English songs and Japanese songs.I lost my voice after this event,my throat was hurt and dry.
April 30 This day is the last day of the April,The small burning wound on my finger i got yesterday has almost cured by the time.There is a bump still remained on my finger but the pain has gone.
