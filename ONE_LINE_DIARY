April 23 I worked late until 23:20 and I felt burned out.
April 24 I had a long sleep during 8-12 P.M. After I woke up, I had two minute headaches.
April 25 Today is a sunny day,After finishing the HIIT workout,I took a shower,than I had my first English lesson,in which it is reading with Venessa through Zoom.
April 26 I've been thinking about what kind of person should be called a procrastinator.I think that i'm one of them because I keep putting off the thing that i don't feel like doing,but it is necessary.
April 27 I slacked off at work.Staying at home the whole day made me feel like i'm isolated from the world
April 28 I stayed up playing games; I felt like garbage.
April 29 I hung out with an Australian friend. we went to karaoke;I sang the song for 2 hours and 30 minutes. I tried Chinese,English and Japanese songs.I lost my voice after this event;my throat was dry and it hurts.
April 30 This day is the last day of April.The small burning wound on my finger that I got yesterday has almost cured.There is a bump that is still remaining on my finger but the pain has gone away. 
May 1 I mostly played games the whole day;It feels bad man.
May 2 I spent the most time of day at outside for shopping, eating and wandering.I followed one of my friend advices getting some cloth items to change fashion style,I ended up buying three items:two trousers,one upbody shirt.
May 3 I went out for workout at around 14:30,I had not done workout around this time before.There were many chidren in the park,I still remember that when I were doing high knees some naugty little girl mimicked my move in a distance.
May 4 I started to watch the Android development lesson I booked last year.This lesson is the most expensive lesson i ever booked by myself in my life so far.But i failed to follow during the Streaming period now all i can do is watching the video version of it.
May 5 I thought about how to make the best of today in the beginning of the day,as today is the last day of Holiday called Golden week in Japan.I spent 3-4 hours to continue watching the video of lesson.I planned to workout outside today,but today is a rainy today.Today's weather provided a perfect excuse for me to not workout outside today.
May 6 First working day after Holiday.I'm quite energetic whole day,as I had enough rest.But I'm starved since I didn't eat anything except few amounts of snacks.I went out for dinner around 7pm.First I went to the Matuya,Name of a chain Restaurant,to have dinner,There were so much people waiting in the line at Matuya,So I changed my order to takeout and went a another Ramen restaurant...
