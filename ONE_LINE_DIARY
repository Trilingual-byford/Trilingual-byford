April 25 Today is a sunny day,After finishing the HIIT workout,I took a shower,than I had my first English lesson,in which it is reading with Venessa through Zoom.
April 26 I've been thinking about what kind of person should be called a procrastinator.I think that i'm one of them because I keep putting off the thing that i don't feel like doing,but it is necessary.
April 27 I slacked off at work.Staying at home the whole day made me feel like i'm isolated from the world
April 28 I stayed up playing games; I felt like garbage.
April 29 I hung out with an Australian friend. we went to karaoke;I sang the song for 2 hours and 30 minutes. I tried Chinese,English and Japanese songs.I lost my voice after this event;my throat was dry and it hurts.
April 30 This day is the last day of April.The small burning wound on my finger that I got yesterday has almost cured.There is a bump that is still remaining on my finger but the pain has gone away. 
May 1 I mostly played games the whole day;It feels bad man.
May 2 I spent the most time of day at outside for shopping, eating and wandering.I followed one of my friend advices getting some cloth items to change fashion style,I ended up buying three items:two trousers,one upbody shirt.
May 3 I went out for workout at around 14:30,I had not done workout around this time before.There were many chidren in the park,I still remember that when I were doing high knees some naugty little girl mimicked my move in a distance.
