I've been thinking about what kind of person should be called a procrastinator.I think that i'm one of them because I keep putting off the thing that i don't feel like doing,but it is necessary.

I started to watch the Android development lesson that I booked last year.This lesson is the most expensive lesson that I have ever booked by myself in my life so far.However, I failed to follow during the Streaming period ,now all that I can do is to watch the video version of it.

I thought about how to make the best of my day.At the beginning of May, the last day of the first week is called Golden Week.I spent 3-4 hours continuing to watch the video of lesson.I planned to workout outside today,but today is a rainy today.Today's weather provided a perfect excuse for me to not workout outside today.

The first working day after the holiday,I was quite energetic the whole day,as I had enough rest.However, I'm starving. I didn't eat anything except a few snacks.I went out for dinner around 7:00 PM.Firstly,I went to the Mastuya, which is the name of the chain restaurant;to have dinner.There were so many people waiting in the line at Mastuya,So I changed my order to takeout and went to another ramen restaurant.

I worked the whole day.I went down to the kitchen for microwaving the baked sweet potato that I ate a bit yesterday.One of my flatmates was cooking there.We talked about something such as "what's up recently".We had a talk about working,salary and cooking regarding the recipe that we used,etc. After the talk, he even treated me with the dish he cooked.

I bought an Ab Wheel.I tried rollout with it after I came back from the shop.It's really hard for me to complete the rollout move.I could not do the perfect rollout move ,since my wrist hurt so hard every time that I tried.However,I still decided to try it every two days and see if it will actually work for me.

I worked for four hours after I had an English reading practice session with Vanessa.At noon, I went down to the first floor to microwave the takeout food that I bought yesterday.I saw the landlord making something with his family.I asked if they were making dumplings.Everybody laughed and said that they were making steamed buns!

I had a video chat from my mom.On my Mom's side there is my Grandmother.Grandmom looks so tired.I tried to speak to her.It seemed like that she could not completely understand what I said, in which she needed lots of strength to manage to give me feedback accordingly.

I started learning how to do video editing ,as I decided to make a video to tell dota2 fans what the story is like in relation to the anime Dragon Blood.At the very beginning,I was so frustrated with myself,since I couldn't handle the editing software well.

I did research online to find a way to remove the acne scar on my back.The result was surprising to me.It said that you need to treat the skin on your back like the skin on your face.Using the face cleanser with the feature of the acne removing properties on your back is one way that is worth trying.

I went to the office,as I had to do some testing related tasks that could only be done with a real mobile phone ,instead of a simulator.We worked until 23:00 Because the project could not compile suddenly due to someone that previously updated some coding,in which lead to this issue.We had to wait for hours to continue the test until Mrs.Saitou fixed this bug.

I had leisure day.I woke up at 11:30,but I didn't get up untill 12:30.I was guessing that wasting time is the nature of human.After that I went out for a meal and managed to buy a acne remedy on my way back home.

I was a bit depressed during the night.I went out to workout at 24:00.However,I couldn't not start workout inmediately when I arrived the party.I end up procrasnated for almost 2 hours by watching videos,messages with phone in the cold night.This is so dumb.
May 18 I did a research about the price of the snack food Juju with walnut online.This snack I could found at Chinese commerical website is 3 times cheaper than I can find in Japan.I was shocked,Then I did another round of research about it.At last,I found that the brand of this snack I can buy Japan is more expensive than anothers.

I bought two takeout after I clock out from work.One is for today's dinner and another one is for tomorrow's lunch.I found that I did't do much cooking after I moved to here,I thought one of reason is that freezer is too small for me to save the food that I usually would make.I'm a fan of making large amount of dishes in one time.what I usually did is that I would make full pot of chicken curry which I could eat it for at least 3 days.So I didn't need to cook everyday.

Today is said to be the Chinese valentine's day.Because "5.20" in Chinese sounds similar to I love you in Chinese.In this day,I had a small talk with Vanessa after work,She asked what kind of girl I like,I said I don't know.I tried to separate the questions into two which is what kind of girl I like in terms of appearance and in terms of personality.At Last She asked me if She is the type of girl I like,I didn't reply but I said that You can be the heroine.
