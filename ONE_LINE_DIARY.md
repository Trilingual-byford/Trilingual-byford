I've been thinking about what kind of person should be called a procrastinator.I think that i'm one of them because I keep putting off the thing that i don't feel like doing,but it is necessary.

I started to watch the Android development lesson that I booked last year.This lesson is the most expensive lesson that I have ever booked by myself in my life so far.However, I failed to follow during the Streaming period ,now all that I can do is to watch the video version of it.
```

I thought about how to make the best of my day.At the beginning of May, the last day of the first week is called Golden Week.I spent 3-4 hours continuing to watch the video of lesson.I planned to workout outside today,but today is a rainy today.Today's weather provided a perfect excuse for me to not workout outside today.

The first working day after the holiday,I was quite energetic the whole day,as I had enough rest.However, I'm starving. I didn't eat anything except a few snacks.I went out for dinner around 7:00 PM.Firstly,I went to the Mastuya, which is the name of the chain restaurant;to have dinner.There were so many people waiting in the line at Mastuya,So I changed my order to takeout and went to another ramen restaurant.

I worked the whole day.I went down to the kitchen for microwaving the baked sweet potato that I ate a bit yesterday.One of my flatmates was cooking there.We talked about something such as "what's up recently".We had a talk about working,salary and cooking regarding the recipe that we used,etc. After the talk, he even treated me with the dish he cooked.

I bought an Ab Wheel.I tried rollout with it after I came back from the shop.It's really hard for me to complete the rollout move.I could not do the perfect rollout move ,since my wrist hurt so hard every time that I tried.However,I still decided to try it every two days and see if it will actually work for me.
```

I worked for four hours after I had an English reading practice session with Vanessa.At noon, I went down to the first floor to microwave the takeout food that I bought yesterday.I saw the landlord making something with his family.I asked if they were making dumplings.Everybody laughed and said that they were making steamed buns!

I had a video chat from my mom.On my Mom's side there is my Grandmother.Grandmom looks so tired.I tried to speak to her.It seemed like that she could not completely understand what I said, in which she needed lots of strength to manage to give me feedback accordingly.

I started learning how to do video editing ,as I decided to make a video to tell dota2 fans what the story is like in relation to the anime Dragon Blood.At the very beginning,I was so frustrated with myself,since I couldn't handle the editing software well.

I got off from work pretty early today.Our team leader started realizing that we've been working overtime for a long period of time,therefore our daily goal is finishing the task that we have before 19:00.

I did research online to find a way to remove the acne scar on my back.The result was surprising to me.It said that you need to treat the skin on your back like the skin on your face.Using the face cleanser with the feature of the acne removing properties on your back is one way that is worth trying.
```

I went to the office,as I had to do some testing related tasks that could only be done with a real mobile phone ,instead of a simulator.We worked until 23:00 Because the project could not compile suddenly due to someone that previously updated some coding,in which lead to this issue.We had to wait for hours to continue the test until Mrs.Saitou fixed this bug.
```
May 16 
```
I had a leisure day.I woke up at 11:30,but I didn't get up until 12:30.I was guessing that wasting time was the natural instinct in the human body.After that, I went out for a meal,and than bought an acne remedy on my way back home.

I was a bit depressed during the night. I went out to workout at 00:00.However,I couldn't start working out inmediately when I arrived at the park.I ended up procrastinating for almost 2 hours by watching videos, as well as messages on my phone in the cold night.This is so dumb.

I did research about the price of the snack food called Juju with walnut online.This snack I can find at a Chinese commerical website for 3 times cheaper than I can find it in Japan.I was shocked, than I did another round of research about it, in which lastly the brand of this snack, I can buy in Japan, which is more expensive than the anothers.

I bought two takeout meals after I clocked out from work.One meal was for today's dinner and the other one was for tomorrow's lunch.I found that I didn't do much cooking after the new area that I moved to.I thought one of the reasons for this was that the freezer was too small for me to save the food that I usually made.I'm a fan of making large amount of dishes at once. What I usually did was to make a full pot of chicken curry,in which I could eat for at least 3 days, so that I didn't need to cook everyday.

Today is said to be Chinese Valentine's Day because "5.20" in Chinese sounds similar to "I love you".On this day,I had a small talk with Vanessa after work,in which she asked what kind of girl that I liked,and I responded to her that I didn't know.I tried to separate the questions into two forms, which was what kind of girl that I liked in terms of appearance ,as well as personality.Lastly, she asked me that if she was the type of girl that I liked. I didn't reply, but I said to her that she could be the heroine.

I rented a Nintendo switch account from a Chinese second hand platform.With this account, I could play 3 games for only one month.I always wanted to play Splatoon 2,in which I had my first regular game today in this regard.I was impressed by the cute sound effects and background music in this game.

I woke up at 11:30.The first thing that I did was to workout at the park.It was such a sunny day today! I was sitting down on the park's bench,in which a little girl was learning how to ride her bicycle with her mom around.At night, before the Japanese lesson,the landlord knocked on my room's door and shared with me some special street foods they just made.I finished the food just before the Japanese lesson started.

May 24 we are here

I went to one of the branches of the Immigration Services Agency of Japan to extend my visa.I ended up spending 5 hours to wait in the line for my application form that i have to hand over to the staff.However,I think that I can be considered lucky because I figured out how many applications they could handle each hour and estimate the time when it's my turn.I went out having lunch instead of staying at the small hall with so many people here.
```
May 25
```
I was informed that the paper I prepared to extend Visa is unsufficient.I need to get a tax payment certification from city hall instead of tax office.Than I went by the city hall of Saitama on my way to office for working.However,The staff there told me that I need to go back where I lived to get the tax payment certification.So I guess that I need to visit one more place to collect the paper.
```
May 26

I had to get up around 9:00 since I have to go to the office around 10:00.Some notification about news came to my phone.I read some of them,One said there were more 4000 people was tested having Covid 19 yesterday each day in Japan.Another one said most Japanese is up agaist the Opening of Olympics in Japan this year,but if the goverment failed to stick to the plan,the money the spent on applying Olympics would not be refund which is a huge financial lost for Japan.what a dilemma.

I got off from work around 7:00,than I went to a Chinese restaurant near to my office for dinner.A set including vegetable noodle and fried rice was ordered by me.I thought the taste must be good,however,I felt like it doesn't as tasty as the one I had here one month ago.The Chinese leaf in the noodle was a bit bitter,and the fried rice was also too mild for me.In the end,I was still stuffed.

I played several games on switch.I can tell that they all are pretty interesting game.One of the game that impressed me is called "Binding of Isaac: Rebirth".In this game,A kid was chased to the Basement by his mom.It turned out that the basement was a world of dungeon.The child,Isaac,use his eye shooting drops of tears to defeat the monster in the dungeon world.One of the features in this game that impressed is that the monsters is human like.For example,One of the Boss is only a head that shoot blood tears or black material.After it got defeated/killed the blood spread everywhere.

At the night,I took a shower and went upstairs to my room.I entered my room and started organizing my clothes,A moth showed up out of nowwhere and was flying around me.I feel annoyed than reached out my hand intuitively trying to grabbed it in flight.I thought that I would failed to caught it.However,when I check my hand,A moth's body was sticked to one of my finger by its body fluids.At that moment I don't know if I should be in good or bad mood .I did killed a bug that it annoying me but I just took a shower and I got my hand dirty.

During the day time,I had the half leftover pizza that I bought yesterday.I was amazed by how long a pizza can keep you away from feeling hungry.Normally I get hungry easily,but after I had the pizza the feeling of hunger never came for two whole days,and one pizza only cost me 600yen.Therefore,Buying pizza for daily life might be the most cost effient way to live in Japan if you were poor.

I worked overtime today.It was around 10:00 when I arrived home.I called my mom when I almost about to finish my dinner.My mom was with my granny in the rural area of hometown.I remembered the last time we had a video call is 2 weeks ago,granny was living in hospital.I seems that grandmom's condition went to the point of no hope to recover.They quitted living at hospital and moved to the place where she was borned.My mom and other siblings is taking turns to look after granny from now.I talked to mom and tried my best to have some conversation with granny,however she looked so tired and couldn't sleep continuously to get enough rest.I think granny already knew that she was about to die， even though mom only told her that she caught cold instead of cancer.

Today is the first day of dota2's Major tournament.
I haven't been playing dota2 seriously for a whole as I found that I am not be able to win the game without lots of practices.
However watching competition is thrilling,no need to think about too much just purely joy.
Some times I wonder why there are so many soccer fan in the world and they don't even play soccer,I feel like I'm becomming the kind of fan who only watches 
but doesn't play it.
